Week 1 Lab: Introduction to SQL

Parch &amp; Posey Database

Parch &amp; Posey is a fabricated non-real company that sells paper:

‚Ä¢ There are 50 sales reps spread across the United States in 4 regions. ‚Ä¢ There are 3 types of paper. Regular, Poster and Glossy.

‚Ä¢ The clients are primarily large Fortune‚Äôs 100 companies.

The Parch &amp; Posey database is provided by Mode Analytics (https://mode.com/).

Questions answered using Parch &amp; Posey data are meant to simulate real word problems. Using SQL, we will help Parch &amp; Posey answer tricky questions like: Which of their product lines is worst performing? Which of their market channels they should make a great investment in.

In the Parch &amp; Posey database there are five tables (essentially 5 spreadsheets):

‚Ä¢ web_events ‚Ä¢ accounts

‚Ä¢ orders

‚Ä¢ sales_reps ‚Ä¢ Region

Figure 1 shows the ERD (entity relationship diagram) for Parch and Posey.

Most of the variables in each table are self-explanatory, but some are not. Here is a description of them:

‚Ä¢ channel: marketing channel (twitter, adwords, organic, banner, facebook, direct) ‚Ä¢ lat: latitude of the company location

‚Ä¢ long: longtitude of the company location

‚Ä¢ primary_poc: primary point of contact

‚Ä¢ sales_rep_id: sales representative id

‚Ä¢ standard_qty: quantity or standard papers ordered

‚Ä¢ poster_qty: quantity of poster papers ordered

‚Ä¢ glossy_qty: quantity of glossy papers ordered

‚Ä¢ total: total quantity of papers ordered (standard + poster + glossy) ‚Ä¢ standard_amt_usd: dollar amount paid for the standard papers

‚Ä¢ poster_amt_usd: dollar amount paid for the poster papers

‚Ä¢ gloss_amt_usd: dollar amount paid for the gloss papers

‚Ä¢ total_amt_usd: dollar amount paid for all paper orders

Creating the Database

<ul>
<li>Open pgAdmin 4</li>
<li>Create a new database, and give it a name. In our case, let‚Äôs call it ‚ÄúParch‚Äù.</li>
<li>Right click on the Parch database, and choose ‚ÄúQurey Tool. . . ‚Äù</li>
<li>Load the database file ‚Äúparch.sql‚Äù and run all the commands (We will discuss these commands later
during the semester, but for now, just think of this step as a database creation and connection)
</li>
<li>Right click on the Parch database, and choose ‚ÄúQurey Tool. . . ‚Äù to create an empty SQL file to query
the Parch database. Don‚Äôt forget to save the file.
</li>
